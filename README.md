## Action and Emotion Recognition by Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

### Introduction
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are designed for processing graph-structured data. This project applies GCNs to recognize actions and emotions, showcasing their ability to interpret complex datasets.

### Definitions
- **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):** Neural network that operates on graph structures.
- **Action Recognition:** Identification of actions from sequences of observations.
- **Emotion Recognition:** Detection of human emotions from physical or facial cues.
